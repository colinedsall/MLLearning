### MLLearning
This is some basic Machine Learning algorithm learning that I have completed alongside the textbook:
+ The Python Workshop Second Edition - Second Edition by Wade, Mario Corchero Jiménez, Bird, Dr. Lau Cher Han, Lee
+ [The Python Workshop Second Edition - Second Edition By : Wade, Mario Corchero Jiménez, Bird, Dr. Lau Cher Han, Lee](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/The-Python-Workshop-Second-Edition)

This repo contains:
+ A Jupyter notebook with notes from a chapter on Machine Learning and the referenced code from the repo above.
+ A simple script that can take a CSV file and determine the best ML algorithm by running several. Refer to the comments in this file if interested.

All sample CSV files are found for free on the internet.
